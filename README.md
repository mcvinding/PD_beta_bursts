## Summary
In the paper we present comparison of spontaneous transient beta bursts between patients with Parkinson's disease and matched healthy controls. We recorded three minutes resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) from 20 Parkinson's patients and 20 healthy controls. From the MEG data we extracted the beta band time-course and characterised spontaneous beta bursts. We then compared features of the beta burst between patients and controls and withing patients ON/OFF medication.
