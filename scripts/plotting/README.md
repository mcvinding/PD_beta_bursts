## Scripts for making plots and figures

`plot_extended.R`: Plot n events across threshold in the extended analysis (`burstanalysis_extended.m`), output of the statistical analysis across thresholds (`statistics/stats_extended.R`) and area under the ROC curve across thresholds.

`plot_fooof.R`: make dotplots of summary measures of the FOOOF (see `scripts/fooof_analysis.py`): beta peak power (Fig 2C), 1/f slope coefficients (Fig. 2D), and 1/f intervept coefficients(Fig. 2E).

`plot_relpow.R`: make dotplots of relative the beta power (Fig 2B).

`plots_main.R`: make dotplots of burst rate (Fig 3), pooled density plots of event duration (Fig. 4B), and pooled density plots of inter-event interval (Fig 4C).

`ROC_plots.R`: plot ROC curves of main outcome variables.

`UPDRSmod_plots.R`: Plot regression models of MSD-UPDRS-III scores and beta burst rate (from `scripts/statistics/UPDRS_stats.R`).
